# TCP Line Reader

A simple Go program that listens on TCP port 8080 and reads incoming text line by line.  
It demonstrates how to handle raw TCP connections, read data in chunks, detect line breaks, and stream lines using channels â€” forming the base for building higher-level protocols like HTTP.
